With the last commit until now( 2014-10-07 22:12:16 ), this demo project has finished some basic functions that includes: 
1, presenting users with a "to-do item list" view, 
2, in the navigation bar of this view, there is an "add" button which allows user to add a to-do item in another view called "add to-do item"  view.
3, user can enter text for the new to-do item in that view's text field.
4, user can either click the "done" or "cancel" button in the navigation bar of that view, both cases would bring users back to the first view, however if "done" is the case, then the new item would be added to the first view.
5, that is all the demo can do.

in the future, I *may* add a web server to store the data generated by this mobile app.
